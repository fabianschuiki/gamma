Game Math Library
=================

A collection of mathematical objects and operations commonly required in game
programming.


Installation
------------

The library itself is ready to use in its source form. Add the Gamma's root directory (where you found this README.md file) to your other project's include path, then use the library like `#include <gamma/vector.hpp>`.

If you prefer an installation and running the unit tests:

	cmake .
	make
	make install
	./tests
